- ### Overview:
This project is a part of the Data Science Working Group - FellowshipPL, Krakow.  A group founded by people passionate about Machine Learning. 
They regularly (twice per year) give students the opportunity to learn.
Malware detection system was built based on the EMBER dataset - a collection of features from PE Windows files.

- ### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to identify useful features for Malware Detection. Features include a handpicked selection of 100 PE libraries, boolean file properties (has_imports, has_exports, has_tls, etc.), 64 bytes of the PE entry point (used as a signature), and other features relevant to malware detection.

- ### Motivation:
After graduation I wanted to hobbistically do some project, to know people from DS world and that is how I have found FellowshipPL. I was reponsible for exploratory data analysis, model training and model evaluation. My work can be found in 'pati' branch as below:
