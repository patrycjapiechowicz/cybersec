### FellowshipPL -

A group founded by people passionate about Machine Learning. 
They regularly (twice per year) give students the opportunity to learn.
One of them was Cybersecurity project.Based on the EMBER dataset - a collection of features from PE Windows files.The aim was to identify useful features for Malware Detection, which means that EDA was very important.
I was mainly reponsible for this part and my work can be found in ## pati branch:
