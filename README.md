This project is a part of the Data Science Working Group - FellowshipPL, Krakow.  A group founded by people passionate about Machine Learning. 
They regularly (twice per year) give students the opportunity to learn.
Based on the EMBER dataset - a collection of features from PE Windows files.

The purpose of this project is to identify useful features for Malware Detection.
I was reponsible for exploratory data analysis, model training and model evaluation. My work can be found in 'pati' branch as below:
